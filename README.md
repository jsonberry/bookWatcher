# Book Watcher

## Install
`yarn` from the root level, this repo is using yarn workspaces

## Serve
`yarn start` from `books-api` and `books-web` to spin up the app

## Purpose & History
I've been pretty bad at finishing books over the past decade. This app started as just little Node scripts that I could run to tell me if I was on track to finish a book, like the minimum pages I needed to read that day in order to finish by a date I set.

## Current
I'm putting in an effort to beef up the app so that it's easier to use and so I can play with new tech. Now I'm using:

1. TypeScript
1. Express
1. SQLite
1. Angular
1. Yarn Workspace
1. Nx Workspaces

## Future
The main purpose of the app and behavior will eventually have a baseline that I won't stray from. This project will act as a sandbox for trying new stuff out, so while look and feel won't change, the underlying technologies will. The idea will be to create modules built with different tech that all aim at the same data. Some stuff to try in the future:

1. Learna
1. Docker
1. Fastify
1. Nest
1. Svelte
1. Angular Universal
1. Polymer
